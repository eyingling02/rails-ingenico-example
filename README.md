# Shoe Shop

Shoe Shop is a website application that was built using Ruby on Rails with a decoupled Node.js server. Ingenico's epayments API is integrated in the Node.js back-end. Shoe Shop shows a user how the front-end portion on the Rails side can make calls to the epayments API when a payment is successfully or unsuccessfully made. This is just one example of how Ingenico's API can be integrated. The front-end uses AJAX/jQuery to make the checkout process easy-to-use and seamless. 

##Setup
* Clone down Shoe Shop 
* Once in the directory via your terminal, run ```bundle install```
* Run the example site with ```rails s``` in the command-line and opening a new tab in your broswer set to http://localhost:3000
